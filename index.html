							<h1>Beyond Information: Online Participatory Culture and Information Disorder</h1>
							<h2>A CSCW 2025 Workshop Offered Online and In Bergen, Norway</h2>
							<h3>Submissions due August 1st!</h3>
						</div>
					</section>

					<section id="zero" class="wrapper style2 fade-up">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2>Introduction and Goals</h2>
							<p>Information disorder (i.e. proliferation of misinformation, disinformation, propaganda, and hate speech) is contributing to intensifying global democratic backsliding, and diminished abilities to understand and address difficult challenges across diverse domains, such as health, migration, and climate science. A contributing factor to information disorder is the internet’s participatory, collaborative, and remix culture, with platforms creating pathways for online audiences to create and spread problematic information. Researchers studying information disorder have become targets of disinformation and harassment campaigns, increasing burnout and underscoring the pressing need and ongoing challenges of conducting this research. These challenges stress the importance of scholars from diverse backgrounds coming together to build networks that increase both the quality of scholarship and capacities to protect and care for targeted researchers. In this proposed CSCW workshop, attendees will identify which directions of empirical research, methods, perspectives, interventions, public communications, and other actions should be prioritized as the community seeks to continue combating information disorder in this difficult climate. Scholars will then share and reflect upon concerns and harms they have endured in pursuing this work, sharing resources that have helped them through these challenges, identifying new potential resources, and opportunities to support one another. 
						</p>

						<h3>Goals of workshop:</h3>

						<ul>
						<li>Developing and strengthening a global network of researchers studying participatory online dynamics and information disorder within and adjacent to the CSCW community.</li>
						<li>Identifying, based on successes and shortcomings of previous work, what empirical research, interventions, frameworks, perspectives, designs (both technological and otherwise), and other actions (e.g. policy work or public communications) should be prioritized at this moment.</li>
						<li>Sharing experiences, resources, and best practices – as well as ideating on new ones – that can support the ability to continue doing this work under threats to researchers, institutions, and the field at large. This includes tangible steps that the conveners may take after this workshop to support each other in continuing this work.</li>

						</ul>

							<h2>Agenda, Format</h2>
							<p>There will be two offerings of this workshop: One online and one in person. This offering modality is in interest of providing a space for people working on these issues to network and find community, despite travel uncertainties. </p>
							<p>The online session is TBD on scheduling and more details. It will likely be a slightly shorter schedule than below, but very similar. </p>
							<h4>Below is a draft schedule of the in person workshop, which is subject to change based on amount of attendees and their interests.</h4>

							<h2>Call for participation</h2>
							<p>It is important to note that <b>CSCW workshops do require a registration fee</b>, which is something workshop organizers cannot control and do not currently know the amount. It will be posted here when we do know. Note: CSCW does practice location based registration fees to promote equity in conference attendance. We are also figuring out what fees may exist for a virtual offering. Rates from last year are <a href = "https://cscw.acm.org/2024/index.php/registration/" target = "blank">here</a>.</p>
							<b><p>We welcome short submissions (2-6 pages before references and appendices) in the ACM single-column format.</p></b>
							<p>Templates: 
							<a class="XqQF9c" href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/word_style/interim-template-style/interim-layout.docx" target="_blank" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;">Word</a> |

							</p>

							<p>All submissions should include an abstract (up to 300 words), which they can opt-in to having posted on the workshop website before the workshop. We will perform a single-blind review of submissions, evaluating them for relevance, originality, quality, and potential to foster conversation. </p>

							<p>Contributions may include position papers, theoretical frameworks, literature reviews, a “prequel” or early findings of empirical work, “coda” work expanding on previously-published work, or other original submissions promoting conversation about information disorder and participatory online culture. Submissions may have multiple authors, but at least one author must attend the workshop and give a brief lightning talk about the work. We welcome various methods and epistemologies in submissions – community-based, quantitative, qualitative, policy, design-based work, and more.</p>

							<p>We actively welcome submissions from contributors who are not “traditional academics” but practitioners from industry (i.e. Trust \& Safety, technologists, journalists, fact-checkers, etc), governmental, nonprofit, or activist organizations. We also encourage contributions from individuals studying participatory online culture outside of the “problematic information” space – particularly those focused on social movements and activism. </p>

							<h4>Submission logistics</h4>
							<ul>
							<li>Submissions are due by August 1st AoE</li>
							<li>An online form for submissions will be posted to this website closer to submission deadline, by mid July at the latest</li>
							<li>In that form, you will mark if you intend to attend an online or in person workshop</li>
							<li>Please note - workshop submissions are not anonymous but they will not be shared beyond the committee nor posted on the website without your consent</li>
